# Shared Slang physics

Slang is the source language for GPU physics. File names describe physics
domains rather than native APIs or solver experiments.

- `types.slang` contains shared resource and value layouts.
- `math.slang` contains numerical helpers.
- `device_intrinsics.slang` contains portable dispatch, barrier, and atomic
  operations.
- `geometry.slang` contains rigid triangle/BVH contact generation.
- `geometry_constraints.slang` contains AVBD contact and joint solving.
- `fluid.slang`, `cloth.slang`, `rope.slang`, `soft_body.slang`, and the smoke
  modules contain their domain kernels.
- Domain-pair files contain coupling kernels.
- `queries.slang` contains scene-query kernels.

The command-API CUDA driver dispatches generated Slang kernels. Its device and
simulation adapters allocate, transfer, synchronize, and dispatch; they do not
contain alternate physics equations.

No Metal device adapter is shipped. Cross-target generation of the shared AVBD
module remains a compiler and reflection portability check; it does not expose
a backend-specific runtime or advertise Metal execution.

## Compiler toolchain

CMake resolves Slang through `cmake/Slang.cmake` and pins version 2026.18. An
offline build can provide the compiler explicitly:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DPARALLEL_MATER_SLANGC_EXECUTABLE=/opt/slang-2026.18/bin/slangc
```

Generated CUDA, PTX, SPIR-V, HLSL, MSL, and reflection records remain in the
build tree.

## Validation

The portable AVBD test executes 105 fixtures against the host reference. The
full mirror target compiles every shared command-runtime entry point to CUDA,
PTX when available, and SPIR-V. The architecture test rejects native CUDA
physics kernels, direct physics launches, legacy command-runtime `World`
dependencies, and dispatch adapters that are not backed by generated Slang.

```sh
cmake --build build --target parallel-mater-slang-geometry-constraints
cmake --build build --target parallel-mater-slang-kernel-mirrors
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure \
  -R 'parallel-mater-(avbd|slang-kernel)'
```

Compilation alone does not qualify a command-API target. Its schedule must use
the shared Slang kernels, pass API and architecture checks, and complete gallery
review on that target. Retired backend-specific adapters are rejected by the
architecture test.
